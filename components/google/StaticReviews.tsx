I got texts all the time inquiring when they could make an offer. Then I got a text with a person's name and company. So I looked them up and got a great idea of who I would be dealing with. Talked with Vince on Friday and on Monday he made an offer that made sense to us. They also paid for moving help for possessions we wanted to store and some to move to the curb for sale. Vince was a wonderful help as well. Closing was a breeze and funds were in our account 2 hours later." },

The entire process was well-organized and completed without delays. I appreciated their transparency and professionalism throughout. Would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a smooth real estate transaction." },

We are very glad that we went forward with Vince Chimoga who did everything they promised. Through every step, this considerate team answered questions and worked with us to alleviate our concerns. Vince made the on-site visit, saw the poor condition, understood our situation, and made a fair offer. Vince arranged the next steps, giving special attention to all our requests. Because he kept us informed throughout the process, making sure things were moving smoothly, we highly recommend OT Investments." },
