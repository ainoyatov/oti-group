      body: `Explore different types of glass used in framing and their benefits. From standard clear glass to museum-quality glazing, each option serves a different purpose depending on your artwork’s value and display environment.
            Non-reflective and UV-protective glass can reduce glare and fading. While more expensive, these choices can drastically extend the lifespan of your framed piece.
            Glass isn’t just a protective layer—it’s a design decision that affects both visibility and preservation. Knowing your options ensures your framing investment is protected for the long haul.`

      tags: ['matting', 'framing', 'presentation'],
      body: `Matting is more than decorative—it's functional. A good mat protects the art by creating space between the piece and the glass, which helps prevent moisture damage.
            It also directs the viewer’s eye and adds balance to the overall presentation. Mat color, texture, and width can dramatically affect how a piece is perceived.
            Choosing the right matting can elevate a basic frame job into a museum-quality presentation.`

      body: `Conservation framing is essential when working with irreplaceable or valuable art. It uses acid-free materials, UV-protective glazing, and reversible mounting techniques to preserve integrity.
            It's not just about protecting the art today—it's about keeping it pristine for future generations.
            Many museums and collectors rely exclusively on conservation methods to ensure their pieces don’t deteriorate over time.`

      body: `Canvas stretching is the process of mounting a loose canvas onto a wooden frame, making it ready for display or framing.
            Proper stretching prevents wrinkles, sagging, and damage. It’s especially important for artists who work with acrylics or oils on unstretched canvas.
            Whether you’re working on a new piece or restoring an old one, knowing how and when to stretch canvas is an invaluable framing skill.`
